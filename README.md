# 👋 Hi, I’m Gaël  
*18-year-old developer passionate about backend systems, infrastructure, and digital sovereignty.*

I’m currently building **Gauzian**, a full web platform designed to be **self-hostable**, **secure**, and **sovereign by design**.  
The idea is simple: modern tools shouldn’t force you to sacrifice privacy or rely on opaque cloud giants.

---

## 🔥 Main Project: **Gauzian**
Gauzian is an all-in-one ecosystem focused on productivity and collaboration, built with:

- **Rust backend** (fast, clean, reliable)
- **Caddy reverse proxy**
- **Docker Compose infrastructure** for simple, reproducible deployments
- **Secure authentication**, versioned notes, smart calendar, collaborative tools

**Long-term vision:**  
Provide mail hosting (SMTP/IMAP), file storage, collaborative editing, and more — all without sending user data to third parties.

> Gauzian is my way of proving that  
> **digital sovereignty isn’t a slogan — it’s something you build, line by line.**

## 🛡️ Why digital sovereignty?
Because no one should have to choose between:

- functionality and freedom,  
- convenience and privacy,  
- innovation and dependency.

My goal isn’t to “rebuild Google”, but to create tools that are:

- transparent,  
- self-hostable,  
- privacy-respecting,  
- and owned **by the user**, not the platform.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies I work with
- **Rust**, **Node.js**, **Docker**, **Caddy**  
- **PostgreSQL**, secure authentication flows  
- **Linux infrastructure**, self-hosting, monitoring  
- Occasionally… **COBOL** (yes, on purpose 😄)

---

## 🎯 What I’m looking for
Projects that bring **real skills**, **real value**, or a **real technical challenge**.  
Special interests include:

- digital sovereignty & self-hosting  
- lightweight but robust infrastructure  
- data security  
- distributed systems (LoRa, ESP32…)  
- local AI (offline inference)
